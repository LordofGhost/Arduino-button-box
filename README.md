<hi/>
 
This is a button box based on an Arduino Uno for computer games.

## The process

### Goals 

- build something that improves the fun of the game
- not spend 400â‚¬ for a bought one

### Challenges

- I had to solder something for the first time
- I did not know how to use the signals from the switches as input to the pc

### Storytelling

### Problem

- I couldn't use the axes of the small joystick

### Solution

- use the axes also as buttons


### 

The whole project is inspired by the youtube channel `amstudio` and the Arduino sketch I got from https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary
