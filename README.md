## The process

### Goals 

- build something that improves the fun of the game
- not spend 400â‚¬ for a bought one

### Challenges

- I had to solder something for the first time
- I did not know how to use the signals from the switches as input to the pc

### Building

- first I cut all the wood parts and glued them together
- next I installed the logitech joystick which is not connected to the arduino
- then I soldered all switches together as you can see on the [`photo`](https://github.com/LordofGhost/Arduino-button-box/blob/main/images/img-8.jpg)
- the last thing i did was cover the wood with foil and build an arm tray out of nubby foam

### Problem

- I couldn't use the axes of the small joystick

### Solution

- use the axes also as buttons

The whole project is inspired by the youtube channel `amstudio` and the Arduino sketch I got from https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary
